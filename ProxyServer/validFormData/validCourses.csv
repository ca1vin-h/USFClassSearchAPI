PHI 6945,Grad Instruction Methods This course focuses on course planning lesson planning and the techniques that improve four core classroom activitiesâ€”questioning writing discussion and lecturing. In all cases the goal is to provide us with clear actionable ways to improve our teaching. This is not a class about pedagogical theoryâ€”it is a class about classroom practice that is informed by research.
