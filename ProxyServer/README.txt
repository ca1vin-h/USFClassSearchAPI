This software is written for a fastapi server to serve the USF schedule planner google chrome extension I am building. This program allows a user to request a course using the semester, subject, and course number. The server saves this information as a json file in case another user requests the same semester/subject/coursenum, then returns the json to the user requesting it.
An example of this server can be found at http://3.15.203.88
Feel free to try out the server with the built in documentation, http://3.15.203.88/docs#
